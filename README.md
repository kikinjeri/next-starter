# Ottawa Eats Social Bot

Ottawa Eats Social Bot is a community‑focused web application built to highlight
local restaurants, share hidden gems, and help people discover where to eat in
different neighbourhoods across Ottawa.

The app connects to **Supabase** for restaurant and menu data, generates
beautiful **HTML restaurant cards**, and posts them directly to **Bluesky** on
the account **@ottawa-eats**.  
The goal is simple:  
**use Bluesky to promote local businesses and make it easier for people to find great food in Ottawa.**

## 🌟 Features

### ✔ Highlight Ottawa Restaurants  
Pulls restaurant data, menus, specials, and neighbourhood info from Supabase.

### ✔ Post to Bluesky  
Automatically publishes restaurant spotlights, sample menus, and promotional
content to the @ottawa-eats Bluesky account.

### ✔ HTML Restaurant Cards  
Generates clean, accessible HTML cards that include:

- sample menu items  
- pricing  
- neighbourhood tags  
- future image slots  

These cards are designed to be readable by search engines and social platforms.

## 🚀 Why HTML Cards Matter

Using HTML instead of plain text or images means:
- Google can **read** the content  
- menu items become **searchable**  
- restaurants can **rank higher** for local food searches  
- posts can help boost visibility for small businesses  
- future integrations (Google Business, structured data, SEO) become easy  

This project is built with long‑term discoverability in mind.

## 🔮 Future Plans

### ⭐ Google Business Posting  
Add the ability to publish restaurant cards directly to Google Business
profiles.  
Because the cards are HTML, Google can:
- parse menu items  
- index dishes  
- improve local search ranking  
- help restaurants appear in “near me” results  

### ⭐ Image Slots  
Add optional image uploads for:
- restaurant storefronts  
- signature dishes  
- interior photos  
- neighbourhood highlights  

These will be included in the HTML card and Bluesky posts.

### ⭐ Automated Scheduling  
Daily or weekly automated posts using Vercel cron jobs.
